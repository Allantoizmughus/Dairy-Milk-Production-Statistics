By **Allan Mugweru**
This application is a uses mathematics to calculate the production of milk in one day, week, month and even year. It is used to simplify the lengthy mathematical calculations needed to get the data.
For the application to run it only needs one to input data in the specified field and it will do the calculations. It does not have many requirements all you need is to download it.
There are no known bugs. The app runs smoothly.
Creating the app I had to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to achieve its functionality.
